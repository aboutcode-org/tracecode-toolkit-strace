include:

* Your operating system name, version and architecture (32 or 64 bits).
* Your Python version.
* Your TraceCode version.
* Any additional details about your local setup that might be helpful to
  diagnose this bug.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug, such as the commands you ran and a link
  to the code you are scanning.
* The errors messages or failure trace if any.
* If helpful, you can add a screenshot as an issue attachment when relevant or
  some extra file as a link to a Gist https://gist.github.com


Documentation improvements
==========================

Documentation can come in the form of wiki pages, docstrings, blog posts,
articles, etc. Even a minor typo fix is welcomed.


Development
===========

To set up TraceCode for local development:

1. Fork tracecode-build on GitHub at
   https://github.com/aboutcode-org/tracecode-build

2. Clone your fork locally::

    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/tracecode-build.git

3. Create a branch for local development::

    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

4. Configure your local environment for development, run the configure script.
   The configure script creates an isolated Python `virtual environment` in
   your checkout directory, the Python `pip` tool, and installs the thirdparty
   libraries (from the `thirdparty/ directory`), setup the paths, etc.
   See https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/ for more details.

   Run this command to configure TraceCode::

        source configure

   On Windows use instead::

        configure

   When you create a new terminal/shell to work on TraceCode, either rerun the
   configure script or `source bin/activate` (or run `bin\\activate` on Windows)

5. Now you can make your code changes in your local clone.
   Please create new unit tests for your code.

6. When you are done with your changes, run all the tests.
   Use this command::

        py.test


7. Commit your changes and push your branch to your GitHub fork::

    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website for this branch.


Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

If you need a code review or feedback while you are developing the code just
create a pull request. You can add new commits to your branch as needed.

For merging, your request would need to:

1. Include unit tests that are passing (run ``py.test``).
2. Update documentation as needed for new API, functionality etc.
3. Add a note to ``CHANGELOG.rst`` about the changes.
4. Add your name to ``AUTHORS.rst``.


Test tips
---------

To run a subset of test functions containing test_myfeature in their name use::

    py.test -k test_myfeature

To run tests verbosely, displaying all print statements to terminal::

    py.test  -vvs
